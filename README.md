Full dataset cannot be uploaded to github because the file is too large.
You can download the used dataset from this site: https://git-disl.github.io/GTDLBench/datasets/mnist_datasets/

Following the download, the file should be placed in the full_data folder. It should be noted that this file will not be pushed to the repository, as it is excluded from the .gitignore file. Subsequently, the path in the Neuronales Netz MNIST.ipynb file for the train and test data must be amended.
